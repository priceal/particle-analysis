# particle-analysis
Tools for analyzing images of particles.







data structures:

We need a dataframe containing an entry for each particle. It should include 

1) a unique index for the particle
2) the (x,y) coordinates in pixels of the central pixel
3) information
    a) the image number for the image where it was found
    b) the ROI parameters (buffer sizes)
